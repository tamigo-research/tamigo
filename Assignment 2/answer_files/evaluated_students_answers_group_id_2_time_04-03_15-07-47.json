        "question": " What happens if a follower crashes or runs slowly during the AppendEntries RPC process?",
        "model_answer": " \nAnswer: According to the context, if a follower crashes or runs slowly during the AppendEntries RPC process, the leader will retry the RPC indefinitely until all followers eventually store all log entries. This ensures that the leader is able to replicate the entry on all servers, even in the face of failures or delays.",

However, the student has not mentioned that the retries will happen indefinitely until all followers have stored the log entries, as stated in the model answer. This could be improved upon. \n3. The student could also mention that this ensures consistency in log replication across all servers, which is an important aspect of the RPC process. \n4. The student has not mentioned anything about the concept of a majority of followers, which is crucial in ensuring successful log replication. This could be added for a more comprehensive answer. \n5. The student could also mention that there is a time limit or lease duration for the AppendEntries RPC process, and if the leader does not receive a successful acknowledgment from the majority of followers within this time, it will retry the process. This adds to the understanding of the process.",

The student's answer is incomplete as it does not mention how Raft assigns serial numbers to commands or how it keeps track of the latest serial number for each client.\n2. The student's answer does not mention how Raft responds to a command with a previously executed serial number. This information is crucial for understanding how Raft handles the possibility of executing a command multiple times.\n3. The student's answer lacks specific details and explanation, making it difficult to understand their understanding of the concept.\n4. The student's answer does not mention the importance of tracking serial numbers in ensuring consistency in the system.\n5. The student's answer does not mention any edge cases or potential problems that may arise with executing commands multiple times, which is important to consider when implementing a distributed system like Raft.",
