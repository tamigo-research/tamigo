        "model_answer": " \n\nAnswer: The authors used two techniques to evaluate and improve the understandability of their design. The first technique was problem decomposition, where they divided complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. The second technique was simplifying the state space by reducing the number of states and eliminating unnecessary nondeterminism.",

        "model_answer": " \nAnswer: Raft uses randomized election timeouts to ensure that split votes are rare and quickly resolved. These timeouts are chosen randomly from a fixed interval, spreading out the servers and increasing the likelihood that only a single server will time out and win the election. The winning server then sends heartbeats to prevent other servers from timing out and starting their own elections.",
