        "model_answer": "The map phase in the MapReduce framework is responsible for processing and transforming input data into intermediate key-value pairs. This phase helps to distribute the workload among multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing of data. This increases the efficiency of data processing in a distributed manner by reducing the time and resources required for the task. Additionally, the map phase also helps to filter and sort data, making it easier for the reducer phase to process and aggregate the results.",
        "student_answer": "Map Phase is used to process the different splits of input data in parallel. Since the input data is processed in parallel, it is going to speed up the overall data processing.",

This allows for efficient sorting and grouping of data by key, which is necessary for the subsequent reduce phase.
