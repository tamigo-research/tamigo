        "model_answer": "The map phase in the MapReduce framework is responsible for processing and transforming input data into intermediate key-value pairs. This phase helps to distribute the workload among multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for parallel processing of data. This increases the efficiency of data processing in a distributed manner by reducing the time and resources required for the task. Additionally, the map phase also helps to filter and sort data, making it easier for the reducer phase to process and aggregate the results.",
        "student_answer": "Map Phase is used to process the different splits of input data in parallel. Since the input data is processed in parallel, it is going to speed up the overall data processing.",

        "model_answer": "\nThe partition phase in MapReduce is responsible for dividing the intermediate key-value pairs generated by the map function into smaller partitions. This ensures that all key-value pairs belonging to the same key are sent to the same reducer, which improves the efficiency and performance of the framework by reducing network traffic and load on individual reducers. The partition function also helps distribute different keys equally among reducers, balancing the workload and improving the overall performance of the MapReduce framework.",
        "student_answer": "In the Partition phase, each mapper divides the intermediate data into different partitions - one each for each reducer. This is done so that the reducer can just read their respective copy of data for further processing.",

        "model_answer": "\nThe shuffle phase in MapReduce is responsible for transferring the intermediate key-value pairs from the mapper to the corresponding reducer based on the key. This ensures that all the values associated with a particular key are grouped together in the same reducer, which is crucial for the proper execution of the reduce function. It also helps balance the workload among the reducers by distributing the different keys equally among the partitions. This phase is performed by the mapper and plays a crucial role in the overall execution of the MapReduce algorithm.",

        "model_answer": " In the sort phase of MapReduce, the partitioning process involves dividing the intermediate key-value pairs into smaller partitions based on a partitioning function. This function ensures that all key-value pairs belonging to the same key are sent to the same partition file and that the different keys are distributed evenly among each of the partitions. This allows for efficient sorting and grouping of data by key, which is necessary for the subsequent reduce phase. Each partition file is then picked up by a specific reducer during shuffling and sorting, and the process is performed by the mapper before sending the data to the reducers. ",
